# Tennis League App

## Work in Progress!

This is an ongoing project.  As of today (6/1/2022), I only have "Court" and "Admin" pages working

## What is this project?

My local tennis league uses spreadsheets and e-mails to manage schedules, scores, and matchups. I've always imagined a web-app that would help facilitate all that overhead and take some work off of the league director and captains.

The completed app should be everything a tennis player needs from the point they're interested in joining a league to tracking their scores or match schedules.

## Technical

Normally I just work with .NET Core and Angular.  With this project I sought to satisfy my curiosity with React and to explore .NET 6 a bit.  Most of this project was written by me, but there is some scaffolding code like service workers and proxy included in the web-project from when I created the React project through Visual Studio.

I made a decision to not implement popular packages like Redux or Nextjs so I could figure out what React has to offer.  Maybe along the way I'll also develop an appreciation for what those packages do when I do learn them.

Things I've learned so far with this project:

- React
- Generic repository pattern
- .NET6 (removal of Startup.cs and being explicit about nullable types)
- Fetch API
- Automapper
- Mock-ups with Figma
