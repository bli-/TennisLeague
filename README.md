# Tennis League App

## Work in Progress!

This is an ongoing project.  As of today (6/14/2022), I have basic pages for everything but the Schedule navigation link.

## What is this project?

My local tennis league uses spreadsheets and e-mails to manage schedules, scores, and matchups. I've always imagined a web-app that would help facilitate all that overhead and take some work off of the league director and captains.

The completed app should be everything a tennis player needs from the point they're interested in joining a league to tracking their scores or viewing schedules.

## Technical

Normally I just work with .NET Core and Angular in my job.  With this project I sought to satisfy my curiosity with React and to explore .NET 6 a bit.  Most of this project was written by me, but there is some scaffolding code like service workers and proxy that were included in the Visual Studio 2022 React template.

For the sake of getting a full project running and to not overwhelm myself with learning a new framework, I chose not to incorporate anything such as Redux or Next just yet.  I also chose to not worry about making pages responsive to save some time.

Things I've learned so far with this project:

- React
- Generic repository pattern
- .NET6 differences from previous versions such as removal of Startup.cs and being explicit about nullable types
- Fetch API
- Automapper
- Mock-ups with Figma
- Basic testing with Jest
